**Self-Driving Car Simulation Using CNN**

**Project Overview**

This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to control the steering of a simulated self-driving car.
Using images captured by the car’s front-facing camera, the model predicts the steering angle needed to keep the car on the road.

A simulation environment provided by Udacity/NVIDIA is used for:

Collecting training data

Testing the trained model in real time

The complete workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, augmentation, CNN model training, and simulation testing.
